# What does it do ?

Patrols Canvas: The script automatically moves your player back and forth across a set area (defined by X and Z coordinates) to keep the Litematica printer running.

​Auto-Refill System: It checks your inventory for all 16 carpet colors. If stocks are low, it automatically walks to your supply area and quickly refills items from up to four stacked chests.

​Handles Kicks/Crashes: If the server kicks you (e.g., for spam/lag), the script automatically reconnects to the server.
​Saves Progress: After reconnecting, it immediately resumes the patrol and printing process from the exact X and Z block where the disconnection happened, so no work is lost.





# Directions to use

Place your Map art schematic.
Reduce printing mode range to 2 or 1 blocks(can be more for maparts with less shades).


‐-------------------------------‐-----------------------------


● Put 4 chests stacked on top of each other near any border of the farm full of all 16 shades of carpets.

● If your mapart uses less than 2 stacks of a shade remove it from carpet list in the script and have that amount of carpet of that shade in your inventory.

● If your mapart doesn't use a shade then remove the carpet from the list in the script.

● If in your mapart one shade is repeated very frequently then change the the minimum amount to what you think will be suitable.
